        <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
          Android: 4 out of 5 smart android phones are NFC enabled. Almost all android smart devices from
          2011 are NFC enabled. Apple: iphone 7 and above running at least iOS 11 are NFC enabled.
          If in doubt, go to the play store or app store, search for TapTap and it will let users know whether
          the smart service is compactible.
